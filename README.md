# 🚗 CS310 - DBMS Course Project: Vehicle Insurance Database Model 🛠️

### **Project Overview**  
As part of our **CS310 - DBMS** course project, we developed a **Vehicle Insurance Database Model** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. Our team designed **relational database models** and crafted **SQL queries** to address key business needs for a vehicle insurance company.

---

## 🎯 **Project Objectives**  
- **Relational Database Design**: Developed normalized data models for a vehicle insurance system.  
- **SQL Query Writing**: Implemented SQL queries to manage and retrieve data efficiently.  
- **OOP Integration**: Applied Object-Oriented Programming concepts in the database structure to ensure scalability and maintainability.

---

## 📦 **Key Deliverables**  
- **Physical Data Model (PDM)** – Required  
- **SQL Queries** – Developed and executed SQL queries to meet project requirements

This project highlights our ability to design **robust databases** and write efficient **SQL queries** in a team-based, real-world scenario.

---

## 🚀 **Key Highlights**  
- **Hands-on Experience**: We applied database design principles and SQL techniques to build a practical system.  
- **Team Collaboration**: Worked together to solve complex database challenges and meet project goals.  
- **OOP Database Design**: Leveraged OOP principles to structure and implement relational databases.
